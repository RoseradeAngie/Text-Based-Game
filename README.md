<p>SLAM/ The doors burst as two men hold you by the arms<p>
<ul>LET GO OF ME</ul> <ul>...where are you taking me?</ul> <ul><b>(shake furiously out of their grip)</b></ul>
<bdi>(<b>(the guards laugh)</b>You aint going anywhere you loon!</bdi> 
<bdi>We're esscorting you to your cell</bdi> 
<bdi>(<b>(the guards instantly hold a tight grip on you)</b>If you're thinking of escaping..dont count on it..</bdi>
<p>The men reached the end of a dark hallway and opened the white sealed door. Once it opened they dragged you inside. You tried to esape their tight grip but it was no use. One of the guards spoke up,"QUIT YOUR WHINING. Not my fault youre a crazy schizophrenic. The doc will check on you in a few. Until then, <b>DONT LEAVE YOUR CELL! UNDERSTOOD?</b> You nod your nead in agreement and put a scowl on your face as the men left the room. <b>SLAM</b></p>
<ul>'look around your cell'</ul> <ul>'think of a way to escape'</ul> <ul>(how did I get here anyway?)</ul>
<bdi>'You can only see white. White walls, white floor...EVERYTHING IS <b>WHITE!!</b>'</bdi>or <ul>'WHITE...ALL WHITE..(slow laughter rises)'</ul>
<bdi>'You can't seem to find a way to escape the room, maybe if you can get the keys from the doc?'</bdi>
<ul>You try to remember how you managed to end up here. You held your best friend in your arms, the voice said <b>Well done</b>You distinctly remember the blaring of the sirens that approached your friend's house. The policemen that barged from the door and stare as your hands are covered in red from your friend. The words <em>PYSCHO</em> and <em>YOU MONStER</em> echoed across the streets as you were essorted to the policecar</ul> 
<p>Suddenly you hear faint foosteps coming this way, the white door is slowly opened with a man in a lab coat. He pulls out 2 chairs and sternly asks you to sit down. "This will just be an evaluation that all inmates have to take when staying in this asylum" You nod your head as you listen to the doc's questions. 30 minutes as the docotr finally ended with the last question. <em>"Do you regret any of the murders you committed in your neighborhood?<em> 
<ul>I don't, they'll thank me later..</ul> <ul>Course not, <b>the voice</b> told me to do it!</ul>
